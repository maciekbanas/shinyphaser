# shinyphaser ![shinyphaser Logo](reference/figures/shinyphaser.png)

This package provides an R Shiny interface to selected features of the
[Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) game framework.

## What you can do with shinyphaser

With the current API, you can build small-to-medium 2D game-like
interactions in Shiny, including:

- 🎮 creating a game canvas in your Shiny UI,
- 🧩 adding images and animated sprites,
- ⌨️ attaching keyboard-based player controls,
- 💥 defining overlap and collision rules between objects,
- 🔔 reacting to game events from R server logic.

## Installation

Install the stable release from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("shinyphaser")
```

Install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("maciekbanas/shinyphaser")
```

## Quick start

You can run the built-in sample app:

``` r
shinyphaser::run_sample_app()
```

Or start from a temporary copy of the example script:

``` r
example_file <- system.file("examples", "hedgehog.R", package = "shinyphaser")
editable_copy <- file.path(tempdir(), "hedgehog.R")
file.copy(example_file, editable_copy, overwrite = TRUE)
file.edit(editable_copy)
```

## Learn by example

For a full walkthrough (from static background to movement, animation,
overlap, and collision), see [**Build your first shinyphaser
game**](https://maciekbanas.github.io/shinyphaser/articles/first-game.html)
