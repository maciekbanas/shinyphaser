# shinyphaser (development version)

* Split event handling into explicit `browser_action` and `server_action`
  parameters. Browser-side calls must now be declared with `browser_actions()`,
  while arbitrary R logic belongs in a server action.
* Removed `action` and `notify_server` from controls, overlaps, overlap-end
  handlers, and colliders.
* Added a vignette explaining when to use browser actions, server actions, or
  both together.

## Performance improvements
* Reduced high-frequency overlap traffic by keeping immediate actions in the browser and registering server events only when a `server_action` is supplied.
* Added explicit `browser_action` declarations for immediate browser-side overlap and collision reactions.
* Extended browser actions with browser state, cooldowns, restricted conditionals,
  overlap/existence predicates, alerts, semantic events, and immediate key controls.
* Overlaps are edge-triggered by default and notify Shiny only when a
  `server_action` is supplied; sustained handlers can use `mode = "stay"` and
  `interval` throttling.
* Moved sprite movement delays from blocking R sleeps to browser timers.
* Queued sprite physics actions until sprites finish loading so setup calls such as `set_gravity()` are not lost during asynchronous asset initialization.

## New interface features

### PhaserGame

* Added `PhaserGame$add_collision_rectangle()` for placing invisible static
  Arcade Physics bodies that can make selected areas impassable without
  rendering additional scene geometry.
* Added `PhaserGame$save_game()` for persisting application state and live
  Phaser object snapshots to server-side JSON files. Saves default to a
  game-specific directory below `tempdir()` and can also accept an explicitly
  captured snapshot for an immediate disk write.
* Added `PhaserGame$list_saved_games()` for retrieving the available
  server-side saves in newest-first order.
* Added `PhaserGame$load_game()` for reading saved application state and
  optionally restoring captured Phaser object positions, visibility, and active
  state in the running scene.
* Added `gravity_x` and `gravity_y` parameters to `PhaserGame$new()` for configuring Arcade Physics world gravity when a game is created.
* Added `PhaserGame$set_world_bounds()` for configuring Phaser physics world and camera bounds from R.
* Added runtime tilemap switching with `PhaserGame$activate_map()`. Multiple
  maps registered with `PhaserGame$add_map()` are loaded in sequence, and map
  activation updates terrain collision, camera and world bounds, the player
  position, and map-specific scene-object visibility.
* Added `PhaserGame$add_proximity_trigger()` for monitoring when a scene object
  is near a point, optionally showing an HTML element or notifying a Shiny input.

### Sprite

* Added `Sprite$start_approach_on_sight()` for browser-side wandering, sight
  checks, alerts, and movement toward a target sprite.
* Added `Sprite$set_player_animation_prefix()` for switching the idle and directional movement animation set used by player controls at runtime.
* Added `Sprite$stop_motion()` for immediately cancelling scripted sprite
  movement, including from `browser_actions()`.

### Other scene objects

* Added sound support with `PhaserGame$add_sound()` and a new `Sound` API for loading, playing, pausing, resuming, stopping, and configuring audio.
* Added `set_scroll_factor()` helpers for scene objects so HUD-style elements can stay fixed while the camera follows another target.
* Added `set_depth()` helpers for sprites, static sprites, images, rectangles, and text
  to control their rendering order, including when depth is set before an asset
  finishes loading. These methods invisibly return their object for chaining.
* Added camera follow helpers for sprites, images, rectangles, static sprites, and text scene objects so the Phaser camera can move with scene objects.
* Added `StaticSprite$destroy()` for removing static sprites from the Phaser scene.
* Added initial visibility control for text objects via `PhaserGame$add_text(..., visible = FALSE)` and `Text$new(..., visible = FALSE)`.
* Added `Text$show()` and `Text$hide()` helpers for toggling text objects after creation.

## Updates in examples
* Added new arcade example game (bear).
* Added the Swamps RPG game example (`swamps_rpg`).
* Updated the sample game to layer its background and score display with
  `set_depth()`.

## README
* Added CRAN downloads badge to README.
* Added animated gif example to README.

# shinyphaser 0.1.0

Initial CRAN release.

* Added an R6-based `PhaserGame` API to define `Phaser.js` scenes, sprites, image assets, groups, and rectangle helpers from R.
* Added Shiny/htmltools bindings that render Phaser games in Shiny apps and synchronize game actions from R to JavaScript.
* Added a sample Shiny app, an end-to-end hedgehog example, package documentation, and test coverage for core methods and sprite behavior.
