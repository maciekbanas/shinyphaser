This package provides an **R Shiny interface to selected features of the
[Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) game framework**.

It is designed to expose a practical subset of Phaser 3 capabilities
inside Shiny apps, so you can build interactive game-like experiences
from R without needing to use the full JavaScript API directly.

## What you can do with shinyphaser

With the current API, you can build small-to-medium 2D game-like
interactions in Shiny, including:

- 🎮 creating a game canvas in your Shiny UI,
- 🧩 adding images and animated sprites,
- ⌨️ attaching keyboard-based player controls,
- 💥 defining overlap and collision rules between objects,
- 🔔 reacting to game events from R server logic.

## Installation

Install the stable release from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("shinyphaser")
```

Install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("maciekbanas/shinyphaser")
```

## Quick start

You can run the built-in sample app:

``` r
shinyphaser::run_sample_app()
```

Or start from the example script:

``` r
file.edit(system.file("examples", "hedgehog_simple.R", package = "shinyphaser"))
```

## Learn by example

For a full walkthrough (from static background to movement, animation,
overlap, and collision), see the vignette:

  game**](https://maciekbanas.github.io/shinyphaser/articles/first-game.html)
